## The Short Version

**Span does not collect any personal information. Period.**

No accounts. No analytics. No telemetry. No tracking. Your files are your business.

## What We Don't Collect

- No user accounts or sign-in required
- No file names, paths, or contents are transmitted anywhere
- No usage analytics, telemetry, or crash reports
- No cookies, tracking pixels, or advertising identifiers
- No data shared with third parties

## Local Data Storage

Span stores the following data **locally on your device only** to provide its functionality:

| Data | Purpose | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| App settings (theme, language, view options) | Preserve your preferences | Windows LocalSettings |
| Tab states (paths, view modes) | Session restore on next launch | Windows LocalSettings |
| Favorite folders | Quick access sidebar | Windows LocalSettings |
| Recent folders | Navigation convenience | Windows LocalSettings |
| FTP/SFTP credentials | Remote server reconnection | Windows ProtectedData (encrypted) |

This data **never leaves your device**. It is not transmitted, synced, or backed up to any external server.

## Network Communication

Span communicates over the network **only** in these user-initiated scenarios:

- **FTP/SFTP connections**: Connecting to servers you explicitly configure
- **Update checks**: Querying GitHub for new versions (no user data included in the request)

No background network activity occurs outside of these actions.

## Third Parties

Span does not share, sell, license, or provide any data to any third party for any purpose.

## Data Deletion

Uninstalling Span removes all locally stored settings and data. You can also reset settings within the app at any time.

## Children's Privacy

Span does not collect data from anyone, including children. All users can use the app equally without any data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this policy will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
